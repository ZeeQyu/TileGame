High priority
    1 Stone-crusher (a machine with pistons aiming each of the four directions,
        so they like crush the rocks around them. 32x32px)

    These three tiles are like a progress bar of how long there is left until a building being built is done.
        1 16x16 just started building-construction site (A package that is opened)
        1 16x16 a third way there construction site (some walls halfway done)

    2 more ore with stump
    2 more ore with package on it

    10 rocks
    Like 10 more grass in the same style with flowers and stuff, feel free to reuse some(and then, no more grass)
	A less dark robot than the current one
	Bullet factory. (32x32)

    Make colliding tiles (trees and rocks) stretch further to the edges
