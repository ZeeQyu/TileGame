TODO list:

1. Collision and tile properties.
2. Optimize the game so that the entire map isn't constructed every time it is drawn.
3. Come up with a better way of doing ticks and movement which lets the player move quicker than a pixel per fps,
	perhaps disconnecting rendering and movement more completely.
