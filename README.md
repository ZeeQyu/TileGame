TileGame
========
An experimental tile-based game about moving resources and building systems by ZeeQyu

Requires Python 3.2 and Pygame for Python 3.2.
**INSTALL.txt** has installation instructions.

Consider reading **concept.txt** for more context on the project

Starting tips: Try building an ore mine, a furnace and a package factory with your starting packages to
    get more packages. 

- **Arrow keys** to move.

- **Z** summons a beetle minion at your feet that randomly roams around.
- Press **X** to duplicate all beetles.
- Press **C** to remove all beetles.
- Press and hold **F** to destroy a tile, for example, trees and buildings.
 
        A visual indicator with a cross shows up if you can't destroy a specific thing.

- Press **D** to place a sapling.
- Press **E** to pick up or place down a package

        (The three things in the middle of the map that spawn right next to you.)

- Press **Q** to open a building menu that is context-sensitive, and will let you build different
    things depending on what you aim at.

        (Aiming at a package on a piece of ore will let you build an ore miner and
        aiming at a package somewhere else will let you build a furnace, package factory, battery factory or launcher.
        Building one of each shows the functionality of all the tiles.
        Start with an ore miner, a furnace and a package factory to generate more packages.)
       
- Press **W** to set a custom delivery target for a building you built using packages and the Q-menu.
    The tile will prioritize that tile over the others.
  
- Press **Space** or **Enter** to select the button you're currently aiming at.
- Press **Insert** to rebind all keys other than Insert.

The game has randomly generated maps that can be rerolled with a button in the **Q**-menu. (Resets all your progress.)
