''' Module /src/maps.py
    TileGame by ZeeQyu
    https://github.com/ZeeQyu/TileGame
    
    Module for handling loading and painting of the map.
    The map is the multidimensional array of tiles 
    which is used for painting the game world on the screen.
    It can be edited easily by replacing an index with a new tile instance.
    
    This module uses PIL for loading the map.png and reading individual pixels.
    Note that graphics.py uses the pygame built-in image library instead.
