Advanced users: Make sure you've got python 2.7.*, PIL and pygame installed, clone the repo and run main.py.

Detailed instructions (Windows):
Install python 2.7.5 from http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.2/python-3.3.2.msi
Install pygame 1.9.1 from http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi

During the installation, make sure you let it modify your path so you can run it from the command line.

open cmd (search for cmd in the search field in the start menu(windows 7)). run the following lines, one by one.

git clone https://github.com/ZeeQyu/TileGame.git
cd TileGame
C:\Python27\python.exe main.py		(or another path if you didn't install it in the default location)

That should do it.
