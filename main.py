''' Module /main.py
    TileGame by ZeeQyu
    https://github.com/ZeeQyu/TileGame
    
    Main module, run this to start the program. Ties all the other modules together.
    
    TileGame is an experimental tile-based game which serves the purpose of letting me learn to use PyGame in a good way.
    Features are added at an irregular basis. Check back now and then to the website written above.
