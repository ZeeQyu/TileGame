''' Module /main.py
    TileGame by ZeeQyu
    https://github.com/ZeeQyu/TileGame
    
    Main module, run this to start the program. Ties all the other modules together.
    
    TileGame is an experimental tile-based game which serves the purpose of
    letting me learn to use PyGame in a good way and evolving my programming capabilities.
    Features are added at an irregular basis. Check back now and then to the website written above.
    Ideas and goals can be found in the concept.txt file
