This is the other_res folder.
In here resides all graphics not currently used in the game,
	for different reasons depending on folder:

	- "alpha" contains images of tiles with transparent backgrounds, for tile generation.
	- "backup" is a folder to back up tiles during graphics experimenting.
	- "notYetUsed" contains what the name suggests: tiles created but not implemented yet.
	- "old" contains all tiles who have been replaced with never ones.
	- "wip" contains tiles which hasn't been completed yet.
